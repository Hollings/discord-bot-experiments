# Pallas - The Discord Bot

## Introduction

This bot saves Spotify song links that are posted to a Discord server into a Spotify playlist.


## Commands

`!playlist` - Returns a link to the playlist that songs are being saved to.

`<any spotify song share link>` - Adds a song to the playlist.



## To Do:

`!ping` - Pong

`!playlist <username> <playlistID>` - Assigns a playlist to be used to save songs (Probably should be locked to a certain mod or admin user role).

`!remove <songID>` - Removes a song from the playlist.

`!undo` - Removes the last added song from the playlist.

Bot reacts with a thumbs up and a thumbs down. If the song link gets more "downvotes", song is removed from the playlist.

Don't add duplicate songs.
